# Introduction

You have probably heard about the benefits of meditation and you want to try it to improve your mental health and self awareness.

Just in case you were previously not yet convinced, here is the short list of meditation benefits.

- alleviates stress and may reduce cortisol levels
- helps alleviate anxiety and depression
- allows you to become more self aware of your emotions and motivations
- will improve your focus and attention span (especially with the simple method I will now teach you)
- may improve sleep
- may improve empathy
- etc...

# The Method

The best method to start a meditation practice consists of 4 steps:
- focus on your breathing
- eventually you will loose focus of your breath and you will be unconscious of it for a while
- you notice that you lost your focus
- you focus on your breathing again

Every time you reach the fourth step of this method, it's like you have done a repetition of a gym exercise, and you have taken one small step to feel the benefits of mindfulness meditation.

# The Mindset

Even though this method is so simple, most people will still say that they can't do it or give up because they don't have the right mindset.

So here are the tips to make this a lasting habit that will work for you.

### It's better to meditate 1 minute everyday than 15 minutes here and there 

Building the habit and being consistent with the practice is the most important component for you to feel the benefits.

### Failing is part of the process

If you have never done this before, it is totally normal if you spend a lot of time in the second step. Don't interpret this as a failure.
Just like a beggining at the gym, you might not be able to do that many repetitions

# Conclusion

I hope this gives you a framework to start a great habit that was personally one of the most impactful ones I have ever tried.
